What I have learned so far:

The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected 
from start to end ( end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array.

In my own words: when you use .slice on an array, it splits the array items into a new array with a start and end
in the main.js file, start and end are defined as variables.

These variables set the start and end of the array for the pagination.
